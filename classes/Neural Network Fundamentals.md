# Neural Network Fundamentals

## Support Vector Machines:

	1. ANN
	2. Support Vector Machine
	3. Machine Learning Construct which Accepts Data
		1. Design Patterns of Neural Networks may correlate with OO Design Patterns

## Representation

1. Numbers in, Numbers out
2. Meaning ain't in the network
3. Propositional Schemas are permitted:
	1. Truth Tables
	2. Predicate Trees

## Expectation Workflows

1. Data is large, which sucks â€” meaning becomes obstructed by relationally or contextually syntactic structures; this makes it harder (or NP Time intensive) to the validation of truth procedures which are representative of truth (large CSV files conceal truth propositions by the density of data structures)
2. Classification Modalities
	1. Feed-Forward
	2. Hopfield

## Data Examples

1. class PixelData extends GridData 


## Classification

1. Classifier Determinations based on Data Relations and Contexts

## Regression

1. Regression Testing > Function Output
2. Instead of Groups, Number Determinations as Weighted Outcomes of Ideal Testnets (Historical Ideals, Performative Ideals, Actual Real Systems)
3. Future Domain-Performance Indicator modulation
4. Normalize by::1/Datarange
5. Neural networks have "thoughts"
6. e.g. Miles per Gallon (0-100)

## Prediction

1. Sampling Interval
2. "End of Day Data"
3. Prediction Windows (Frames; e.g., 2days, 3days, etc.) change depend on the Security
4. Elmen Type Network / Jordan Type Network are Recurrent Type Networks

## Ideas

1. OWL Schemas as a basis for ANN Modeling
2.
