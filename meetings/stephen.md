1. Slippage Tracking 
2. Bots trading on slippage (China)
3. Bitnit
4. 1.5%/week
5. China reacts slower than the USD price corrects
	1. more us bots following china than vice
6. csv >> stephen.pettyjohn@gmail.com
7. 2 mo << historical data
8. 3 weeks << demo data :: if had money
9. 1 money << promise data (live)
	1. determining range based on liquidity 
10. profit loss historically speaking — profiling bad trades [timestamps on trades]
11. defaults have characteristics over certain populations
12. orderdef
13. risk minimalization
	1. correct weights in paths — pairs not worth trading
	2. weighting risk, must check GDP
	3. adjusting for risk — train multiple iterations of bot
	4. correct for direction of the market
	5. direction and return correctly normalized weights
	6. rebuilding based on prior market
		1. randomizing liquidity (or trade exposure)
			1. 9 out of 10 shortest path won't support capital (1M)
			2. jane street, wolverine,  (never 1.5% of operating capital) — minimally exposed, determine best exposure strategy 
		2. randomzing about trading against pairs
14. shortest path construction method
15. (downflow) maxflow — weight the constraints to be trained
	1. edge have weights and flow, though weights would be manually imputted / pull closer to the correct strategy based on slippage
16. banks with expected slippage, prop firms — predicting slippage
17. watch out for bad market assumptions (manual weights)
